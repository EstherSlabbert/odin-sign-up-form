# The Odin Project: Sign-up form

This is my solution to the [Odin Project's](https://www.theodinproject.com/) project: Sign-up form. It is a basic sign-up form page layout design based on the specifications found [here](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-intermediate-html-and-css-sign-up-form) and modified to my preferences.
